# HSharpVE_Engine
HSharpVE Engine - revived project. Was written in C# for Cosmos C#, but now it will be rewritten in C++.
(this is dummy README, will be written from scratch when some alpha versions of program will be completed)
- What this VE Engine does?
- It acts like Java. It will have tokenizer and lexical analyzer, like actual compiler does. It should compile into IB - intermediate bytecode, and then executed by VM. VM always was a dream for me, now im going to write it. So, lets go.
(ofc VM in theory should work like JVM)
